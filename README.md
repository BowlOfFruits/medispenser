Utilising the keras package in python, we've managed to train and create a model that recognises faces, and who that face belongs to! This is the first step to automating medication collection, without the need for a human! 

Our project will be implemented in old folks home, to ease the load of doctors and nurses incharge. Through user feedback as well as input from larger organisations in this field, it's efficiency can be improved and expanded to other institutions such as major hospitals.
